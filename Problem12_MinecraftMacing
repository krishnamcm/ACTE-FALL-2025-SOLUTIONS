#Suppose the answer is 2 and thus Wemmbu divides the opponents into two groups
#Then his average has to be higher then both groups; i.e., W > a_1 (the average of group 1) and W > a_2 (the avergae of group 2)
#Then it's pretty intuitive: the average of a_1 and a_2 is still going to be smaller than W (formally, (a_1 + a_2)/2 <= max(a_1, a_2) and W > a_1 and W > a_2)
#Thus, if Wemmbu combines the groups into one, he can beat the entire group at once because his skill level is higher
#The same logic applies to any number of groups, ergo any combination of players can be combined into one beatable group
#So the answer is always one
